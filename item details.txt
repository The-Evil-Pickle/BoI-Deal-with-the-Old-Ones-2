Wings of Icarus:
*Gives flying
*+0.1 speed
*Chance for tears to be flaming tears, which do only 0.1 damage but set enemies on fire (12% chance, increased by player luck. chance drops to 0 on proc, then builds back up over the next few shots)

*When going fast enough, the player is protected from taking damage (goes on cooldown after activating)

Confusion:
*Tears have a chance to take on random and chaotic movement patterns. Tears that do this also confuse hit enemies (usually. there is a chance for other status effects to be applied instead of or along side confusion).

Rabbit's Paw:
*+2 luck
*+0.025 speed

*Common pickups (hearts, bombs, keys, coins) have a high chance to be whatever the player would find least useful (usually whatever they have the most of)
*Chance of this happening is dependent on how much of each collectible the player has, and decreases slightly based on luck.

*Chance of this effect not causing a curse is increased by player luck
*Curse of the maze becomes more common than other curses, while curse of the unknown and blind become less common

*Items will randomly be replaced with better items.
*For this effect, all items have been ranked into 40 tiers based on community opinion.
*This effect ignores item pools, so this item causes a similar effect as what Chaos does.
*How much better the new item is from the original one is random, but dependent on luck.
*Low-tier items have better chances of going up multiple tiers when replaced than already-high-tier items do.
*Will not replace modded items or items from some of the most recent booster packs (no data for what tier those items are).
*Replaces all compatible items in treasure rooms, 50% chance for compatible items sold in shops, 50% chance for compatible items in boss rush.

Broken Compass:
*Greatly increases chance of encountering a limbo room after a boss fight
*Chance for limbo room opening can never drop below 20% after all other modifiers are accounted for - even if an angel or devil room opened
*An open limbo room door will always remain open when the player exits and re-enters the boss room.
*Note: Unlike the other items added by this mod, the Broken Compass is found outside the limbo room; it is in the curse room and red chest item pools.
 ^(It can still appear in limbo rooms, but it has a much lower chance to appear than other items do)

 -Player takes 1 full heart of damage
 -Player is teleported to a random room on the floor
 -Mom's foot randomly stomps the room (high priestess effect)
 -Screen becomes pixelated briefly

*+0.1 speed
*+1 luck
*+0.1 shot speed

Red Brush:
*+1 heart of max health
*In active rooms, the walls will periodically start bleeding.
*When this event starts, all enemies in the room take damage equal to ~15% of the player's Damage stat (slight random variance). Enemies cannot die from this damage.

==========================================
Interactions / additions to existing items

Missing Poster: Makes limbo doors more likely to appear
==========================================
Curse of the Tomb:

*Curse of the Tomb will never appear under normal circumstances.
*If the player has Broken Mirror or Dead Beetle, Curse of the Tomb can appear just like any other curse (but it is a bit more rare than the vanilla ones).

-Multiple red/half/blended hearts
-A limbo cyclopia (rarely)
-A limbo maw (rarely)
-A bunch of troll bombs
-1-3 spiders

-Golden key (very rarely)
-Golden bomb (very rarely)
-Limbo entrance (very rarely when not already in limbo)

==========================================
How unlocking limbo doors works:
After a boss is defeated, there is a chance for a door to a limbo room to open.
The base for this chance is 100%, but it is modified by a large number of conditions.
*If the number of collectibles the player has is more than 2X the current floor number, chance of a limbo door opening is reduced by 10% for each item over the limit.
*If a devil or angel room opened after this boss fight, chance of a limbo door opening is reduced by 150%; unless the player has Duality, in which case it is increased by 20%.
*Chance is increased by 10% per point of luck the player has (negative luck will decrease the chance, but never by more than 25%)
*Chance is increased by 10% for each limbo-exclusive item the player has (except broken mirror, which increases chance by 20% instead to counterbalance the negative luck, and rabbit's paw, which gives nothing to counterbalance the positive luck)
*Chance is increased by 5% for each of Chaos, Cursed Eye, or Curse of the Tower the player has
*Chance is increased by 25% if the player is holding the missing poster trinket
*Chance is increased by 10% if the player is holding the Dead Beetle trinket, up to 50% if Curse of the Tomb is also active
*Chance is increased by 5% if the player is holding the Ancient Pebble
*Chance is increased by 10% if Curse of the Lost is active
*Chance is reduced by 75% if the player is on the first floor
*Chance is reduced by 30% if the player is on the second floor
*Chance is reduced by 100% if the player is on the past the ninth floor
*Chance is reduced by 50% if the player has the dark angel transformation
*Chance is reduced by 25% if the player has the light angel transformation
*Chance is reduced by 25% if the player has the guppy transformation
*Chance is reduced by 30% if the player is playing as Apollyon
*Chance is reduced by 10% if the player is playing as Isaac
*On the first 2 floors, if the player is playing as Isaac or Azazel, chance is reduced by 15%
*Chance is increased by 100% and cannot total to below 20% if the player has the Broken Compass
All numbers listed above are additive, not multiplicitive.
The limbo room door may or may not stay open when the player leaves the boss room and comes back.
Chance of the door remaining open is half the chance of it opening in the first place. If the player has the Broken Compass, it always remains open.

==========================================
If the statue in Limbo is destroyed, one of the two angels will spawn.
Angels in limbo rooms work differently than those in angel rooms. The differences are:
-300 hitpoints (angel room bosses have 400)
-Uriel spawns with a white cyclopia champion
-Gabriel spawns random cyclopia champions rather than angelic babies
If the player has a key piece, angels in limbo drop the other one.
If the player has no key piece, or has completed the key, angels have a 50% chance to drop a limbo active item, and a 50% chance to drop a random limbo item + trinket.
